# 3. Conditionals & Expressions

## Instructor notes
- Booleans
- Ternary (`x ? a : b`)
- Mathematical Operators * / + - < > % >= <= == !+
- If/Else
- and/or/not
- Add some numbers together
- May need to make this more on the reading side, bc there's not much "real" that can be done with conditions at this stage
