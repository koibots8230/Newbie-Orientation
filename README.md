# Welcome to the Koibots!

This is to teach you the basics on how to program in java, and more specifically, on the robot. You are required to do **all** of the lessons. You don't have to read the entire lesson if you already know it. You do however, have to do the exercise at the end. Don't forget to commit and push after each exercise, or we won't be able to see that you did it. If you have any questions, google it first(if applicable), then ask. We are happy to help. Good luck!

*Note:* It is highly recommended to view the lessons on github. You can view them in VS code, but it won't look as nice and will be harder to navigate

## Getting Started
1. Ensure you've downloaded and installed [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib). If you haven't instructions are [here](https://koibots8230.github.io/koidocs/vscode.html).
2. Make sure [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed
   + On your school MacBook run ```xcode-select --install``` to install Git
   + Otherwise, use the link above to download and install Git
3. Clone this git repository
   1. Click on the green `<> Code` button above the files
   2. Copy the link
   3. Open a terminal window
   4. Type in `git clone `, then paste
   5. Hit enter
4. Open the new folder inside of VS Code, it should be in the folder with your student id
5. Create a branch with your name by running `git checkout -b YourName`
6. Start completing the exercises

*Note:* If you cannot push, you might have to setup a key:
   1. In terminal type ssh-keygen
   2. Type `cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub`
   3. Copy the text it outputs
   4. In github, click on your profile icon in the top right, and select settings
   5. Navigate to "SSH and GPG Keys"
   6. Hit "New SSH Key"
   7. Name it and then paste the text into the key section
   8. Hit save
   9. Try and push now
